# Notes

## Introduction

This is a basic project introducing for Socket.io, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.

This was a research work for the grupal project that requires a chat and room which needeed all these technologies.

The notes can be added, deleted and modified from the client and are live-updated in all clients which are opened.

We are using Mongo so they can be accesed later and they are still there.
